# Hi, I'm Sameera.

 I am a Design Director at [thoughtbot](http://www.thoughtbot.com), a writer and conference speaker. I serve on multiple Design advisory boards in Austin for organizations and educational institutions. I call Bombay, Cura√ßao, and Austin "home". I make [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/hamtequila) and travel a lot. I cook and I [photograph](http://www.instagram.com/the_tableaux) the process.

I am also a designer and an educator. I formerly served as Instructional Director, Academic Operations Director, and Diversity Director, managing instructors and curriculum across 21 locations, a nationwide scholarship, and  helped start or run two diversity councils as ERGs (employee resource groups).

I taught design at the university-level for over six years, teaching courses from freshman year to seniors, and serving on multiple graduate thesis committees. I wrote the first university course on the topic of Responsive Web Design in 2011 and have presented at conferences across the US.

I write and speak about web and product design, diversity, inclusion, and equity, tech education involving emerging tech, and design research and process. I share my thoughts on the web in the documentary, [What Comes Next Is The Future](http://www.futureisnext.com/). I wrote for [The Pastry Box Project](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/baker/sameera-kapila) (2015, 2018), a monthly column for [net magazine](http://www.creativebloq.com/author/sam-kapila) print and online for over two years, and for other publications, as well as served on [design competition juries](http://samkapila.com/writing-and-community/). I've spoken at events such as Creative Mornings, SXSW's HBCU track, and more.
