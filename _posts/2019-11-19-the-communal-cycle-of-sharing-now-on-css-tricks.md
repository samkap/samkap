This week, [CSS-Tricks](http://www.css-tricks.com) rolled out a new series of posts about what web builders are excited about this year (2019/2020). I crossed a career bucket list item off my list by contributing a short read on what I'm excited about. And, as you may be able to guess by the title, it's about how we share on the web. In the piece, I talk about how opportune it is of a time to build on the web; the web is fairly young and its one of few mediums that we can say really say is collaborative.

Checking out [the post](https://css-tricks.com/the-communal-cycle-of-sharing/) on CSS-Tricks along with all of the other [ongoing series](https://css-tricks.com/category/2019-end-of-year-thoughts/).
