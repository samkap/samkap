Happy new year!

This morning, I realized that I was using liquid code that didn't automatically update my site footer's copyright year. Thanks to friends, [Andy](https://twitter.com/piccalilli_/status/1344799360098435075?s=20) and [Eric](https://twitter.com/ericwbailey/status/1345013452381810688?s=20), I just happened to check my site and say that the liquid code only updated if there was a new version of the site compiled AKA I had to write something new. I followed the instructions on the link Eric posted and made the update as not to have to depend on a new post for the footer to update to the right year.

I also realized that while I had been pushing to rename all `master` branches at work, I hadn't really worked on my site in a while and hadn't updated my branch to `main`. So I did so this morning following [Scott's advice](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/easily-rename-your-git-default-branch-from-master-to-main) that required some quick updates in the terminal and in my site repo settings. I use a bookmarklet to add links to my site, so I updated the branch in its settings, as well. Finally, I moseyed over to Netlify and updated my deploy settings there.
Quick and easy, and all of this took under 30 minutes.

And, I cleaned up a few tags that had funky formatting.

Here's to starting the new year right!
